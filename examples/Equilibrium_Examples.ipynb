    "We start with an equilibrium where the plasma is entirely contained by its last-closed-flux-surface (LCFS), which goes through at least one of the X-points (saddle-points in $\\psi$) and does not intersect the tokamak's limiter. We start with an _inverse_ solve, where we specify a few points that must lie on the same LCFS, and the coil currents are then determined together with $\\psi(R,Z)$. We then show how to do a _forward_ solve, for which we need to specify the currents instead, and the profile $\\psi(R,Z)$ is to be determined. The invere solve alternates a Picard iteration ($\\psi^{(n+1)}=(\\Delta^*)^{-1}\\psi^{(n)}$) with one adjustment in the coil currents such that the resulting LCFS is as close as possible to the prescribed constraints, iterating until convergence. The forward solver uses the Newton-Krylov implementation described by Amorisco et al (2024) in _Physics of Plasmas_."
