# Examples

These example Jupyter notebooks are intended to be the **first port of call for new users** trying to get up to speed with the basics of simulating Grad-Shafranov equilibria using FreeGSNKE.

| Example notebook | Purpose | Who can use it? |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| Example 0 | Learn how to build a generic tokamak object. | Anyone |
| Example 1a | Learn how to use the static forward and inverse solvers to simulate equilibria in a MAST-U-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 1b | Learn how to use the magnetic probes object in a MAST-U-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 2 | Learn how to use the evolutive solver to simulate time-dependent equilibria in a MAST-U-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 3a/b | Simulate (static) MAST-U equilibria over an entire shot using inputs from EFIT++ (requires internal UKAEA MAST-U database). | UKAEA employees + collaborators |
