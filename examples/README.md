# Examples

These example Jupyter notebooks are intended to be the **first port of call for new users** trying to get up to speed with the basics of simulating Grad-Shafranov equilibria using FreeGSNKE (the numberings represent approximately increasing complexity!). Most examples will use a MAST-U-like tokamak machine, unless otherwise specified. 

| Example notebook | Purpose | Who can use it? |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| Example 00 | Learn how to build a generic tokamak object. | Anyone |
| Example 01a | Learn how to use the static inverse solver. | Anyone |
| Example 01b | Learn how to use more advacned features of the static inverse solver. | Anyone |
| Example 02 | Learn how to use the static forward solver. | Anyone |
| Example 03 | Learn how to extract results from a calculated equilibrium. | Anyone |
| Example 04 | Learn how to use the magnetic probes object. | Anyone |
| Example 05 | Learn how to use the evolutive solver to simulate time-dependent equilibria. | Anyone |
| Example 06a/b | Simulate (static) MAST-U equilibria over an entire shot using inputs from EFIT++ (requires internal UKAEA MAST-U database). | UKAEA employees + collaborators |
| Example 07 | Static inverse solve in a SPARC-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 08 | Static inverse solve in an ITER-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 09 | Learn how to use and build virtual circuits for plasma shape control. | Anyone |
