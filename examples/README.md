# Examples

These example Jupyter notebooks are intended to be the **first port of call for new users** trying to get up to speed with the basics of simulating Grad-Shafranov equilibria using FreeGSNKE (the numberings represent increasing complexity!). 

| Example notebook | Purpose | Who can use it? |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| Example 00 | Learn how to build a generic tokamak object. | Anyone |
| Example 01 | Learn how to use the static inverse solver in a MAST-U-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 02 | Learn how to use the static forward solver in a MAST-U-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 03 | Learn how to extract results from a calculated equilibrium. | Anyone |
| Example 04 | Learn how to use the magnetic probes object in a MAST-U-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 05 | Learn how to use the evolutive solver to simulate time-dependent equilibria in a MAST-U-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 06a/b | Simulate (static) MAST-U equilibria over an entire shot using inputs from EFIT++ (requires internal UKAEA MAST-U database). | UKAEA employees + collaborators |
| Example 07 | Static inverse solve in a SPARC-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 08 | Static inverse solve in an ITER-like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 09 | Learn how to use and build virtual circuits in a MAST-U like tokamak. | Anyone |
| Example 10 | Learn how to calculate growth rates associated with vertically unstable modes in a MAST-U like tokamak. | Anyone |
