    "This example notebook shows how to solve for different flavours of Grad-Shafranov equilibria: inverse and forward solve for diverted configurations; and inverse and forward solve for limited plasmas. The profiles chosen for this notebook follow the notation of Jeon (2015) for the toroidal plasma current:\n",
    "$$j_{pl}=\\left( 1-\\psi_{n}^{\\alpha_m} \\right)^{\\alpha_n}\\left( \\lambda\\beta_{0}R/R_{0}+(1-\\beta_{0})\\lambda R_{0}/R \\right) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The first contribution is the pressure support $p^{\\prime}(\\psi_{n})$, the second one is the toroidal-field support $f'f.$\n",
    "The examples are given for a parameterisation of the plasma pressure in terms of $p_a,$ the pressure on axis, and then again for a \"BetapIp\" profile object, with a proxy to the poloidal beta of the plasma. The \"Lao profiles\" would correspond to $\\alpha_m=2$ and $\\alpha_n=1.$\n",

    "We start with an equilibrium where the plasma is entirely contained by its last-closed-flux-surface (LCFS), which goes through at least one of the X-points (saddle-points in $\\psi$) and does not intersect the tokamak's limiter. We start with an _inverse_ solve, where we specify a few points that must lie on the same LCFS, and the coil currents are then determined together with $\\psi(R,Z)$. We then show how to do a _forward_ solve, for which we need to specify the currents instead, and the profile $\\psi(R,Z)$ is to be determined. The invere solve alternates a Picard iteration ($\\psi(R,Z) \\mapsto (\\Delta^*)^{-1}\\psi(R,Z)$) with one adjustment in the coil currents such that the resulting LCFS is as close as possible to the prescribed constraints, iterating until convergence. The forward solver uses the Newton-Krylov implementation described by Amorisco et al (2024) in _Physics of Plasmas_."

Note that, while the \"equilibrium\" object is instantiated directly through FreeGS, the internal \"PaxisIp\" object is instantiated through FreeGSNKE. This is because, depending on the version of FreeGS that you use, there may be a more efficient way of computing and sufacing some variables in that profile class. FreeGSNKE has an internal check that can cope with that. Alternatively, you can also use the object as provided by FreeGS instead."
