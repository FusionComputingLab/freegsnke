    "  $$\n",
    "  \\psi(R_j, Z_j) = \\psi_j^{\\text{target}}.\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  More generally, one could prescribe $\\psi(R,Z)$ over a region (e.g. a full flux map). Flux values are typically difficult to estimate a priori to simulation and so the following constraint is often more useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalised flux values (`psi_norm_limits`)**  \n",
    "  At a location $(R_j, Z_j)$, we can impose upper (or lower) bound constraints on the normalised flux \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\hat{\\psi}(R,Z) = \\frac{\\psi(R,Z) - \\psi_{axis}}{\\psi_{boundary} - \\psi_{axis}},\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "  \\hat{\\psi}(R_j, Z_j) \\leq \\hat{\\psi}_j^{\\text{target}}.\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  Note that $\\psi_{axis}$ and $\\psi_{boundary}$ are the values of the flux on the magnetic axis and plasma boundary, respectively.\n",
    "  As we'll see, this can be useful for setting explicit constraints on flux behaviour near the wall if there are certain safety limits to adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we stress that users should be mindful of specifying too many constraints that may conflict with one another during an inverse solve. For example, a given normalised $\\psi$ constraint may be impossible/difficult to achieve given other isoflux constraints or coil current limits. More generally, specifying too many constraints could make the problem ill-posed and reduce the overall quality of the final solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that if you find that the solver is violating the limit (inequality) constraints (coil limits and normalised $\\psi$), you should look to reduce the number of constraints or try modifying the `mu_*` parameters. These parameters control how much a violation of the constraint is penalised in the solver, and increasing this penalty (by increasing `mu_*`) will increase the likelihood the constraint is adequately satisfied. Again, it may also be that the constraint is impossible to satisfy given your other constraints.\n",
    "\n",
