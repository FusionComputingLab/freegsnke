    "# Example: Virtual circuit calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook will demonstrate how to construct **virtual circuits** (VCs) for a **MAST-U-like tokamak** equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Virtual Circuits and why are they useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "VCs can be used to identify which (active) poloidal field (PF) coils have the most significant impact on a set of specified plasma shape parameters (which we will refer to henceforth as **targets**). The targets are equilibrium-related quantities such as the inner or outer midplane radii $R_{in}$ or $R_{out}$ (more will be listed later on). \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, the **virtual circuit** (VC) matrix $V$ for a given equilibrium (and chosen set of shape targets and PF coils) is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = (S^T S)^{-1} S^T, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the **shape** (Jacobian) matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S_{i,j} = \\frac{\\partial T_i}{\\partial I_j}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $T_i$ is the $i$ th target and $I_j$ is the current in the $j$ th PF coil. We note that $V$ is simply the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of $S$. In FreeGSNKE, $S$ will be calculated using finite difference (see below). \n",
    "\n",
    "### How can these VCs be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the VC matrix $V$ for a given equilibrium (and its associated target values $\\vec{T}$), we can specify a perturbation in the targets $\\vec{\\Delta T}$ and calculate the change in coil currents required to acheive the new targets. The shifts in coil currents can be found via:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{\\Delta I} = V \\vec{\\Delta T}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using $\\vec{\\Delta I}$ we can perturb the coil currents in our equilibrium, re-solve the static forward Grad-Shafranov (GS) problem, and observe how the targets (call them $\\vec{T}_{new}$) have changed \n",
    "in the new equilibrium vs. the old targets $\\vec{T}$.\n",

    "### Calculating the VCs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we've defined the targets we're interested in, we can begin calculating the **shape** and **virtual circuit** matrices. The following is a brief outline of how they're calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Initialise and solve the base equilibrium\n",
    "Before computing derivatives, the static forward GS solver is run with some initial coil currents. Following this we store the:\n",
    "- equilibrium state `eq` and plasma profiles `profiles`.\n",
    "- plasma current vector $I_y$ (which defines the amount of plasma current at each computational grid point, restricted to the limiter region to save computational resources).\n",
    "- target values $\\vec{T} = [T_1,\\ldots,T_{N_T}]$ are evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This establishes a reference state before we perturb the coil currents - we have already carried out these steps above (the $I_y$ vector is stored within `profiles`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Find the appropriate coil current perturbations\n",
    "Next, we need to identify the appropriate coil current perturbations $\\vec{\\delta I}$ to use in the finite differences. To do this, we aim to scale the starting guess `starting_dI` (denoted $\\vec{\\delta I}^{start}$) according to the target tolerance on the plasma current vector (`target_dIy` = $\\delta I_y^{target}$). While the user can choose `starting_dI`, the default is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{\\delta I}^{start} := | \\vec{I} | \\times \\delta I_y^{target}.  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For each coil current $j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,N_c \\}$, this starting guess is scaled as follows:\n",
    "1. Perturb coil current $j$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_j^{new} := I_j + \\delta I_j^{start}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Solve the equilibrium with the updated $j$ th coil current (others are left unchanged) and store the plasma current vector $\\vec{I}_y^{new}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The starting guess for the $j$ th coil current perturbation is then scaled by the relative norm of the plasma current change (and the predefined target tolerance `target_dIy`):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta I_j^{final} = \\delta I_j^{start} \\times \\left( \\delta I_y^{target} \\frac{\\| \\vec{I}_y^{start} \\|}{\\| \\vec{I}_y^{new} - \\vec{I}_y^{start} \\|} \\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If this relative norm is larger than $\\delta I_y^{target}$, then the starting guess $\\delta I_j^{start}$ needs to be made smaller (and vice versa). \n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we have our scaled perturbations $\\vec{\\delta I}^{final}$ ready to use in the finite differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Find the finite differences (i.e. the shape matrix)\n",
    "For each coil current $j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,N_c \\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perturb coil current $j$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I_j^{new} := I_j + \\delta I_j^{final}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Solve the equilibrium with the updated $j$ th coil current (others are left unchanged) and store the plasma current vector $\\vec{I}_y^{new}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using the new target values $\\vec{T}^{new}$ from the equilibrium, calculate the $j$ th column of the shape matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S_{:,j} = \\frac{\\vec{T}^{new} - \\vec{T}}{\\delta I_j^{final}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the sensitivity of each of the targets $T_i$ with respect to a change in the $j$ th coil current.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can also obtain the Jacobian matrix of the plasma current vector (using $\\vec{I}_y^{new}$) with respect to the coil currents: $\\frac{\\partial \\vec{I}_y}{\\partial \\vec{I}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Find the virtual circuit matrix\n",
    "Once the full shape matrix $S \\in \\Reals^{N_T \\times N_c} $ is known, the **virtual circuit matrix** is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = (S^T S)^{-1} S^T \\in \\Reals^{N_c \\times N_T}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix provides a mapping from requested shifts in the targets to the shifts in the coil currents required."
